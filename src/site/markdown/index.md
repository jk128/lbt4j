# About

lbt4j is a Java API that offers over a JNI-library access to [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/).

It is generated by using [codegenj](https://github.com/olir/codegenj) and [gdbus-codegen](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gdbus-codegen.html).

It reads [D-Bus Introspection XML] (https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#introspection-format)
 files and generates maven projects. 

 
## Build

### Maven

You can build the jar file and documentation with maven:

> mvn clean package site site:run

Open the project documentation in your web browser on http://localhost:9000 
or open it without site:run under

> target/site/index.html

You can compile the jni library from the target (jni/ and classes/):

> cd target/jni

> make clean all

## Download

Get the **jar** here: [MavenCentral](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22lbt4j%22)  
*TODO: javadoc and native downloads.*

## HOWTO

This projects build the jar. It is to be used with the The native library build in
 [lbt4j-lib] (https://github.com/olir/lbt4j-lib).

Call your testclient like this:

> java -cp testclasses:lbt4j-0.3.1.jar -Djava.library.path=jni TestClient

where jni is the folder the native library renamed to **libbluezdbus.so** must be placed.
